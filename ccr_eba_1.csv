Principles for business line mapping


1.  
Institutions shall develop and document specific policies and criteria for mapping the relevant indicator for current business lines and activities into the standardised framework set out in Article 317. They shall review and adjust those policies and criteria as appropriate for new or changing business activities and risks.


2.  

Institutions shall apply the following principles for business line mapping:


(a) 


institutions shall map all activities into the business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner;




(b) 


institutions shall allocate any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary activity to an activity included in the framework, to the business line it supports. Where more than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, institutions shall use an objective-mapping criterion;




(c) 


where an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then institutions shall use the business line yielding the highest percentage. The same business line equally applies to any ancillary activity associated with that activity;




(d) 


institutions may use internal pricing methods to allocate the relevant indicator between business lines. Costs generated in one business line which are imputable to a different business line may be reallocated to the business line to which they pertain;




(e) 


the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes shall be consistent with the categories institutions use for credit and market risks;




(f) 


senior management shall be responsible for the mapping policy under the control of the management body of the institution;




(g) 


institutions shall subject the mapping process to business lines to independent review.

EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2017.

2.  

To be permitted to use the Alternative Standardised Approach, an institution shall meet all the following conditions:


(a) 


its retail or commercial banking activities shall account for at least 90 % of its income;




(b) 


a significant proportion of its retail or commercial banking activities shall comprise loans associated with a high PD;




(c) 


the Alternative Standardised Approach provides an appropriate basis for calculating its own funds requirement for operational risk.

Quantitative Standards


1.  
The quantitative standards referred to in Article 312(2) include the standards relating to process, to internal data, to external data, to scenario analysis, to business environment and to internal control factors laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 respectively.


2.  

The standards relating to process are the following:


(a) 


an institution shall calculate its own funds requirement as comprising both expected loss and unexpected loss, unless expected loss is adequately captured in its internal business practices. The operational risk measure shall capture potentially severe tail events, achieving a soundness standard comparable to a 99,9 % confidence interval over a one year period;




(b) 


an institution's operational risk measurement system shall include the use of internal data, external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business environment and internal control systems as set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. An institution shall have in place a well documented approach for weighting the use of these four elements in its overall operational risk measurement system;




(c) 


an institution's risk measurement system shall capture the major drivers of risk affecting the shape of the tail of the estimated distribution of losses;




(d) 


an institution may recognise correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk estimates only where its systems for measuring correlations are sound, implemented with integrity, and take into account the uncertainty surrounding any such correlation estimates, particularly in periods of stress. An institution shall validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques;




(e) 


an institution's risk measurement system shall be internally consistent and shall avoid the multiple counting of qualitative assessments or risk mitigation techniques recognised in other areas of this Regulation.





3.  

The standards relating to internal data are the following:


(a) 


an institution shall base its internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a three-year historical observation period;




(b) 


an institution shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 317 and into the event types defined in Article 324, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In exceptional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line ‘corporate items’. An institution shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. An institution shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that the institution has historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, provided that the institution is required to continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. An institution shall include operational risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk;




(c) 


an institution's internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations. An institution shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. An institution shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection;




(d) 


aside from information on gross loss amounts, an institution shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event;




(e) 


an institution shall have in place specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from a loss event in a centralised function or an activity that spans more than one business line, as well as from related loss events over time;




(f) 


an institution shall have in place documented procedures for assessing the on-going relevance of historical loss data, including those situations in which judgement overrides, scaling, or other adjustments may be used, to what extent they may be used and who is authorised to make such decisions.





4.  

The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following:


(a) 


an institution's operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system;




(b) 


an institution shall regularly review the conditions and practices for external data and shall document them and subject them to periodic independent review.





5.  
An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness.


6.  

The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following:


(a) 


an institution's firm-wide risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile;




(b) 


an institution shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas;




(c) 


an institution shall be able to justify to competent authorities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution's risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume;




(d) 


an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, an institution shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.

1.  
The competent authorities shall permit institutions to recognise the impact of insurance subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 and other risk transfer mechanisms where the institution can demonstrate that a noticeable risk mitigating effect is achieved.


2.  
The insurance provider shall be authorised to provide insurance or re-insurance and shall have a minimum claims paying ability rating by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions under Title II, Chapter 2.


3.  

The insurance and the institutions' insurance framework shall meet all the following conditions:


(a) 


the insurance policy has an initial term of no less than one year. For policies with a residual term of less than one year, an institution shall make appropriate haircuts reflecting the declining residual term of the policy, up to a full 100 % haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less;




(b)

However, the insurance policy may exclude any fine, penalty, or punitive damages resulting from actions by the competent authorities;




(d) 


the risk mitigation calculations shall reflect the insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the overall determination of operational risk capital;




(e)

1.  

Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for market risk under the sensitivities-based method by aggregating the following three own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325h:


(a) 


own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its non-volatility related risk factors;




(b) 


own funds requirements for vega risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its volatility-related risk factors;




(c) 


own funds requirements for curvature risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in the main non-volatility related risk factors not captured by the own funds requirements for delta risk.

For the purpose of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1,


(a) 


all the positions of instruments with optionality shall be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 for the risks other than exotic underlyings of the instruments as referred to in point (a) of Article 325u(2);

For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments with optionality include, among others: calls, puts, caps, floors, swap options, barrier options and exotic options. Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be stand-alone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.
For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying's notional amount shall be considered to be instruments without optionality.

3.  
For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risks to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in Subsection 2 of Section 3.

(ii) 


in all other cases, institutions shall assign the sensitivity to the relevant index bucket.







2.  

By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate a single sensitivity to a position in a listed equity or credit index for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements for delta and curvature risks provided the listed equity or credit index meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3. In that case, institutions shall assign the single sensitivity to the relevant bucket as set out in Subsection 1 of Section 6 as follows:

1.  

An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a position in a CIU using one of the following approaches:


(a) 


where an institution is able to obtain sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of the CIU, the institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that CIU position by looking through to the underlying positions of the CIU as if those positions were directly held by the institution;




(b) 


where the institution is not able to obtain sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of the CIU, but the institution has knowledge of the content the mandate of the CIU and daily price quotes for the CIU can be obtained, the institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that CIU position by using one of the following approaches:


(i) 


the institution may consider the position in the CIU as a single equity position allocated to the bucket “other sector” in Table 8 of Article 325ap(1);




(ii) 


upon permission from its competent authority, an institution may calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of the CIU in accordance with the limits set in the CIU’s mandate and relevant law;






(c) 


where the institution meets neither the conditions in point (a) nor (b), the institution shall allocate the CIU to the non-trading book.




An institution that uses one of the approaches set out in point (b) shall apply the own funds requirement for the default risk set out in Section 5 of this Chapter and the residual risk add-on set out in Section 4 of this Chapter where the mandate of the CIU implies that some exposures in the CIU shall be subject to those own funds requirements.
An institution that uses the approach set out in point (ii) of point (b) may calculate the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk and own funds requirements for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative positions of the CIU, using the simplified approach set out in paragraph 3 of Article 132a.

2.  
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where an institution has a position in a CIU that tracks an index benchmark so that the annualised return difference between the CIU and the tracked index benchmark over the last 12 months is below 1 % in absolute terms, ignoring fees and commissions, the institution may treat that position as a position in the tracked index benchmark. An institution shall verify compliance with that condition when the institution enters into the position and, after that, at least annually.

However, where data for the last 12 months are not fully available, an institution may, subject to permission from the institution’s competent authority, use an annualised return difference from a period shorter than 12 months.

3.  
An institution may use a combination of the approaches referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 for its positions in CIUs. However, an institution shall use only one of those approaches for all the positions in the same CIU.


4.  

For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, an institution shall carry out the calculations under the following provisions:


(a) 


for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, the CIU shall first take position to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirements set out under that Section and shall then continue taking positions in descending order until the maximum total loss limit is reached;




(b) 


for the purposes of the own fund requirements for the default risk set out in Section 5 of this Chapter, the CIU shall first take position to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirements set out under that Section and shall then continue taking positions in descending order until the maximum total loss limit is reached;




(c) 


the CIU shall apply leverage to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law, where applicable.




The own funds requirements for all positions in the same CIU for which the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph are used shall be calculated on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio using the approach set out in this Chapter.

Where institutions use the general interest rate risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from the own funds requirements for credit spread risk. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to the risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes.

4.  
In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6.

Institutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.

5.  
Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless of the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described in this paragraph, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket.


6.  
Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities-based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or euro. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over US dollar or basis over euro either on ‘basis over US dollar’ or ‘basis over euro’.

Each cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each debt instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are cross-currency bases used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.
Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the cross-currency basis risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over euro and basis over US dollar, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two.

7.  
The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be one bucket per currency.

For netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.
Where institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply:


(a) 


where the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped to that maturity;




(b) 


where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows:


(i) 


the first risk factor shall be mapped to the maturity of the option;




(ii) 


the second risk factor shall be mapped to the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option.





8.  
The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.


9.  
Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency.

1.  
Institutions shall derive sensitivities from the institution's pricing models that serve as a basis for reporting profit and loss to senior management, using the formulas set out in this Subsection.

By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, competent authorities may require an institution that has been granted permission to use the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b to use the pricing functions of the risk-measurement system of their internal model approach in the calculation of sensitivities under this Chapter for the calculation and reporting of the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 430b(3).

2.  
When calculating delta risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (a) of Article 325e(2), institutions may assume that the implied volatility risk factors remain constant.


3.  

When calculating vega risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (b) of Article 325e(2), the following requirements shall apply:


(a) 


for general interest rate risk and credit spread risk, institutions shall assume, for each currency, that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows either a lognormal or normal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments;




(b) 


for equity risk, commodity risk and foreign exchange risk, institutions shall assume that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows a lognormal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments.





4.

Adjustmentlong



=


where the instrument from which the exposure arises is a derivative instrument, the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; increases shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and decreases shall enter into the formula with a negative sign.





2.

JTDshort = min {LGD Vnotional + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}
where:


JTDshort



=


the gross JTD amount for the short exposure;


Vnotional



=


the notional amount of the instrument from which the exposure arises that shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;


P&Lshort

Jump-to-default amounts for the ACTP


1.  

For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:


(a) 


‘decomposition with a valuation model’ means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;




(b) 


‘replication’ means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;




(c) 


‘decomposition’ means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.





2.  
The gross JTD amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the ACTP shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.


3.  

Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points:


(a) 


attachment point = (N – 1) / Total Names;




(b) 


detachment point = N / Total Names;
where ‘Total Names’ shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool.

Jump-to-default amounts for the ACTP


1.  

For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:


(a) 


‘decomposition with a valuation model’ means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;




(b) 


‘replication’ means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;




(c) 


‘decomposition’ means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.





2.  
The gross JTD amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the ACTP shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.


3.  

Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points:


(a) 


attachment point = (N – 1) / Total Names;




(b) 


detachment point = N / Total Names;
where ‘Total Names’ shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool.





4.  

Net JTD amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures that are otherwise identical except for maturity. Offsetting shall only be possible as follows:


(a) 


for indices, index tranches and bespoke tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the provisions on exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325x; long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts that perfectly replicate each other may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model; in such cases, the sum of the gross JTD amounts of the single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross JTD amount of the undecomposed exposure;




(b) 


offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for resecuritisations or derivatives on securitisation;




(c) 


for indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche by replication or by decomposition; where the long exposures and short exposures are otherwise equivalent, apart from one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net JTD amount shall reflect the residual exposure;




(d) 


different tranches of the same index series, different series of the same index and different index families may not be used to offset each other.

Regulatory back-testing requirements and multiplication factors


1.  

For the purposes of this Article, an ‘overshooting’ means a one-day change in the value of a portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated on the basis of the institution's alternative internal model in accordance with the following requirements:


(a) 


the calculation of the value at risk shall be subject to a one-day holding period;




(b) 


scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desk's positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;




(c) 


data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);




(d) 


unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's alternative internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1).





2.  
Institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk.


3.  

An institution's trading desk shall be deemed to meet the back-testing requirements where the number of overshootings for that trading desk that occurred over the most recent 250 business days does not exceed any of the following:


(a) 


12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;




(b) 


12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio;




(c) 


30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;




(d) 


30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.





4.  

Institutions shall count daily overshootings in accordance with the following:


(a) 


the back-testing of hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and, assuming unchanged positions, the value of the portfolio at the end of the subsequent day;




(b) 


the back-testing of actual changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day, excluding fees and commissions;




(c) 


an overshooting shall be counted for each business day for which the institution is not able to assess the value of the portfolio or is not able to calculate the value-at-risk number referred to in paragraph 3.





5.  
An institution shall calculate, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article, the multiplication factor (mc) referred to in Article 325ba for the portfolio of all the positions assigned to the trading desks for which it has been granted permission to use alternative internal models as referred to in Article 325az(2).


6.  

The multiplication factor (mc) shall be the sum of the value of 1,5 and an add-on between 0 and 0,5 in accordance with Table 3. For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 5, that add-on shall be calculated on the basis of the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph. The calculation of the add-on shall be subject to the following requirements:


(a) 


an overshooting shall be a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following:


(i) 


a one-day holding period;




(ii) 


a 99th percentile, one tailed confidence interval;




(iii) 


scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desks' positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;




(iv) 


the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);




(v) 


unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1);






(b) 


the number of overshootings shall be equal to the greater of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.

In extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may limit the add-on to that resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes where the number of overshootings under back-testing actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.

7.  
Competent authorities shall monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 5 and the compliance of trading desks with the back-testing requirements referred to in paragraph 3. Institutions shall promptly notify, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme and provide an explanation for those overshootings, and in any case shall notify the competent authorities thereof no later than within five business days after the occurrence of an overshooting.


8.  
By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Article, competent authorities may permit an institution not to count an overshooting where a one-day change in the value of its portfolio that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution's internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor. To do so, the institution shall demonstrate to its competent authority that the stress scenario risk measure calculated in accordance with Article 325bk for that non-modellable risk factor is higher than the positive difference between the change in the value of the institution's portfolio and the related value-at-risk number.


9.  
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements to be included in the actual and hypothetical changes to the value of the portfolio of an institution for the purposes of this Article.

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.

the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in Subsection 1 of Section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&L attribution requirement referred to in Article 325bg; an institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model;




(b) 


the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk;




(c) 


the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors that correspond to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance-sheet positions; the institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches; the yield curve shall be divided into various maturity segments to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve; for material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be modelled using a minimum of six maturity segments, and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution's trading strategies, the model shall also capture the risk spread of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves or different financial instruments on the same underlying issuer;




(d) 


the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated; for CIUs, the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account; institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, provided that the correctness of that report is adequately ensured; foreign exchange positions of a CIU of which an institution is not aware of shall be carved out from the internal models approach and treated in accordance with Chapter 1a;




(e) 


the sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions' activities in the equity markets; the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions and at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor on the individual risk factors for each equity market;




(f) 


the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions, unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities, in which case it may use a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type; for material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between commodities that are similar, but not identical, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches, and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions;




(g) 


the proxies used shall show a good track record for the actual position held, shall be appropriately conservative, and shall be used only where the available data are insufficient, such as during the period of stress referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(2);




(h) 


for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options' maturities.





2.  
Institutions may use empirical correlations within broad categories of risk factors and, for the purpose of calculating the unconstrained expected shortfall measure UESt as referred to in Article 325bb(1), across broad categories of risk factors only where the institution's approach for measuring those correlations is sound, consistent with the applicable liquidity horizons, and implemented with integrity.

For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors.2.  The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.3.  The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.4.  The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.5.  To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:(a) the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03 %;(b) the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;(c) the default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combination with current market prices, data observed during a historical period of at least five years of actual past defaults and extreme declines in market prices equivalent to default events; default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices;(d) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate default probabilities;(e) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities; in both situations, the estimates of default probabilities shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.6.  To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements:(a) the loss given default estimates are floored at 0 %;(b) the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;(c) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate loss given default estimates;(d) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate loss given default; in both situations, the estimates of loss given default shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.7.  As part of the independent review and validation of the internal models that they use for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk-measurement system, institutions shall:(a) verify that their approach for the modelling of correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors in the model;(b) perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations; and(c) apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.The tests referred to in point (b) shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced.8.  The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions.9.  The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.10.  Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default assumptions for correlations between different issuers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bn(1) and the preferred choice of method for estimating the default probabilities in point (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article and the loss given default in point (d) of paragraph 6 of this Article.11.  Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation assumptions and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.12.  EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that an institution's internal methodology or external sources are to fulfil for estimating default probabilities and losses given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Footnotes

For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors.2.  The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.3.  The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.4.  The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.5.  To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:(a) the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03 %;(b) the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;(c) the default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combination with current market prices, data observed during a historical period of at least five years of actual past defaults and extreme declines in market prices equivalent to default events; default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices;(d) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate default probabilities;(e) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities; in both situations, the estimates of default probabilities shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.6.  To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements:(a) the loss given default estimates are floored at 0 %;(b) the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;(c) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate loss given default estimates;(d) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate loss given default; in both situations, the estimates of loss given default shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.7.  As part of the independent review and validation of the internal models that they use for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk-measurement system, institutions shall:(a) verify that their approach for the modelling of correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors in the model;(b) perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations; and(c) apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.The tests referred to in point (b) shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced.8.  The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions.9.  The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.10.  Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default assumptions for correlations between different issuers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bn(1) and the preferred choice of method for estimating the default probabilities in point (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article and the loss given default in point (d) of paragraph 6 of this Article.11.  Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation assumptions and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.12.  EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that an institution's internal methodology or external sources are to fulfil for estimating default probabilities and losses given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Footnotes

1.  
Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows.

Credit Derivatives


1.  

When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the ‘protection seller’), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:


(a) 


a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;




(b) 


a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds;




(c) 


a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;




(d) 


in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk;




(e) 


a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.




A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.
Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable.

2.  
For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the ‘protection buyer’, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a step-up, such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.


3.  
Credit derivatives in accordance with Article 338(1) or (3) shall be included only in the determination of the specific risk own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338(4).

Maturity-based calculation of general risk


1.  
In order to calculate own funds requirements against general risk all positions shall be weighted according to maturity as explained in paragraph 2 in order to compute the amount of own funds required against them. This requirement shall be reduced when a weighted position is held alongside an opposite weighted position within the same maturity band. A reduction in the requirement shall also be made when the opposite weighted positions fall into different maturity bands, with the size of this reduction depending both on whether the two positions fall into the same zone, or not, and on the particular zones they fall into.


2.  
The institution shall assign its net positions to the appropriate maturity bands in column 2 or 3, as appropriate, in Table 2 in paragraph 4. It shall do so on the basis of residual maturity in the case of fixed-rate instruments and on the basis of the period until the interest rate is next set in the case of instruments on which the interest rate is variable before final maturity. It shall also distinguish between debt instruments with a coupon of 3 % or more and those with a coupon of less than 3 % and thus allocate them to column 2 or column 3 in Table 2. It shall then multiply each of them by the weighing for the maturity band in question in column 4 in Table 2.


3.  
The institution shall then work out the sum of the weighted long positions and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band. The total of the matched weighted positions in all bands shall then be calculated.


4.  

The institution shall compute the totals of the unmatched weighted long positions for the bands included in each of the zones in Table 2 in order to derive the unmatched weighted long position for each zone. Similarly, the sum of the unmatched weighted short positions for each band in a particular zone shall be summed to compute the unmatched weighted short position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long position for a given zone that is matched by the unmatched weighted short position for the same zone shall be the matched weighted position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long or unmatched weighted short position for a zone that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched weighted position for that zone.

Duration-based calculation of general risk


1.  
Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 339, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis.


2.  
Under the duration-based approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each fixed-rate debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of floating-rate instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed.


3.  

The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula:


where:

D


=


duration calculated according to the following formula:


where:

R


=


yield to maturity;


Ct



=


cash payment in time t;


M


=

Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections.

4.  

The institution shall then allocate each debt instrument to the appropriate zone in Table 3. It shall do so on the basis of the modified duration of each instrument.

5.  
The institution shall then calculate the duration-weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest-rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).


6.  
The institution shall calculate its duration-weighted long and its duration-weighted short positions within each zone. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched duration-weighted position for that zone.

The institution shall then calculate the unmatched duration-weighted positions for each zone. It shall then follow the procedures laid down for unmatched weighted positions in Article 339(5) to (8).

7.  

The institution's own funds requirement shall then be calculated as the sum of the following:

2 % of the matched duration-weighted position for each zone;




(b) 


40 % of the matched duration-weighted positions between zones one and two and between zones two and three;

1.  
An allowance shall be given for hedges provided by credit derivatives, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 to 6.


2.  
Institutions shall treat the position in the credit derivative as one ‘leg’ and the hedged position that has the same nominal, or, where applicable, notional amount, as the other ‘leg’.


3.  

Full allowance shall be given when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same extent. This will be the case in the following situations:


(a) 


the two legs consist of completely identical instruments;




(b) 


a long cash position is hedged by a total rate of return swap (or vice versa) and there is an exact match between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure (i.e., the cash position). The maturity of the swap itself may be different from that of the underlying exposure.




In these situations, a specific risk own funds requirement shall not be applied to either side of the position.

4.  
An 80 % offset will be applied when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure. In addition, key features of the credit derivative contract shall not cause the price movement of the credit derivative to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80 % specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction with the higher own funds requirement, while the specific risk requirements on the other side shall be zero.


5.  

Partial allowance shall be given, absent the situations in paragraphs 3 and 4, in the following situations:


(a) 


the position falls under paragraph 3(b) but there is an asset mismatch between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure. However, the positions meet the following requirements:


(i) 


the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation;




(ii) 


the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same obligor and have legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses;






(b) 


the position falls under paragraph 3(a) or paragraph 4 but there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying asset. Such currency mismatch shall be included in the own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk;




(c) 


the position falls under paragraph 4 but there is an asset mismatch between the cash position and the credit derivative. However, the underlying asset is included in the (deliverable) obligations in the credit derivative documentation.




In order to give partial allowance, rather than adding the specific risk own funds requirements for each side of the transaction, only the higher of the two own funds requirements shall apply.

1.  
Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk. Under such an approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, provided that the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.


2.  

Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in point (a), subject to the following conditions:


(a) 


the purpose of the CIU's mandate is to replicate the composition and performance of an externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities;




(b) 


a minimum correlation coefficient between daily returns on the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks of 0,9 can be clearly established over a minimum period of six months.





3.  

Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions:


(a) 


it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position;




(b) 


institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate;




(c) 


if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level.





4.  

Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter:


(a) 


the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository;




(b) 


for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).




The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.

(b)

The risk- measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held.





2.  

Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements:


(a) 


the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;




(b) 


the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3);




(c) 


the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;




(d) 


the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;




(e) 


the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.

Parameters of the internal IRC model


1.  
Institutions shall use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.


2.  
Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.


3.  
The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected.


4.  
The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are re-balanced at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption.


5.  
The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed.


6.  
The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months.


7.  
The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an institution's internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securitisation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions.

Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments.

An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.


2.  

For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution:


(a) 


chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions;




(b) 


demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement;




(c) 


demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies shall be reflected in the own funds requirement.

Requirements for an internal model for correlation trading


1.  
Competent authorities shall grant permission to use an internal model for the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio instead of the own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338 to institutions that are allowed to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments and that meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article and in Article 367(1) and (3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370.


2.  
Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.


3.  

The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1:


(a) 


the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products;




(b) 


credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects;




(c) 


volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations;




(d) 


basis risk, including both of the following:


(i) 


the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names;




(ii) 


the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios;






(e) 


recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices;




(f) 


to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges;




(g) 


any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio.





4.  
An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products.

The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission.

5.  
With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio.

Competent authorities shall grant permission to use an internal model for the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio instead of the own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338 to institutions that are allowed to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments and that meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article and in Article 367(1) and (3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370.


2.  
Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.


3.  

The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1:


(a) 


the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products;




(b) 


credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects;




(c) 


volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations;




(d) 


basis risk, including both of the following:


(i) 


the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names;




(ii) 


the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios;






(e) 


recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices;




(f) 


to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges;




(g) 


any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio.





4.  
An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products.

The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission.

5.  
With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio.


6.  
The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.

Settlement/delivery risk

In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed.
The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.
The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appropriate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

Advanced method


1.  
An institution which has permission to use an internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363 (1) shall, for all transactions for which it has permission to use the IMM for determining the exposure value for the associated counterparty credit risk exposure in accordance with Article 283, determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk by modelling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads on the CVAs of all counterparties of those transactions, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386.

An institution shall use its internal model for determining the own funds requirements for the specific risk associated with traded debt positions and shall apply a 99 % confidence interval and a 10-day equivalent holding period. The internal model shall be used in such way that it simulates changes in the credit spreads of counterparties, but does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, including changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.
The own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:


where:

ti



=


the time of the i-th revaluation, starting from t0=0;


tT



=


the longest contractual maturity across the netting sets with the counterparty;


si



=


is the credit spread of the counterparty at tenor ti, used to calculate the CVA of the counterparty. Where the credit default swap spread of the counterparty is available, an institution shall use that spread. Where such a credit default swap spread is not available, an institution shall use a proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty;


LGDMKT



=


the LGD of the counterparty that shall be based on the spread of a market instrument of the counterparty if a counterparty instrument is available. Where a counterparty instrument is not available, it shall be based on the proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty.

The first factor within the sum represents an approximation of the market implied marginal probability of a default occurring between times ti-1 and ti;

EEi



=


the expected exposure to the counterparty at revaluation time ti, where exposures of different netting sets for such counterparty are added, and where the longest maturity of each netting set is given by the longest contractual maturity inside the netting set; An institution shall apply the treatment set out in paragraph 3 in the case of margined trading, if the institution uses the EPE measure referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) for margined trades;


Di



=


the default risk-free discount factor at time ti, where D0 =1.


2.  

When calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk for a counterparty, an institution shall base all inputs into its internal model for specific risk of debt instruments on the following formulae (whichever is appropriate):


(a) 


where the model is based on full repricing, the formula in paragraph 1 shall be used directly;




(b) 


where the model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, an institution shall base each credit spread sensitivity ('Regulatory CS01') on the following formula:


For the final time bucket i=T, the corresponding formula is






(c) 


where the model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in credit spreads, an institution shall use the following formula:






(d) 


where the model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit spreads (spread gamma), the gammas shall be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 1.





3.  

An institution using the EPE measure for collateralised OTC derivatives referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) shall, when determining the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1, do both of the following:


(a) 


assume a constant EE profile;




(b) 


set EE equal to the effective expected exposure as calculated under Article 285(1)(b) for a maturity equal to the greater of the following:


(i) 


half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;




(ii) 


the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.







4.  
An institution which is permitted by the competent authority in accordance with Article 283 to use IMM to calculate exposure values in relation to the majority of its business, but which uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for smaller portfolios, and which has permission to use the market risk internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363(1) may, subject to permission from the competent authorities, calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1 for the non-IMM netting sets. Competent authorities shall grant this permission only if the institution uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for a limited number of smaller portfolios.

For the purposes of a calculation under the preceding subparagraph and where the IMM model does not produce an expected exposure profile, an institution shall do both of the following:


(a) 


assume a constant EE profile;




(b) 


set EE equal to the exposure value as computed under the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6, or IMM for a maturity equal to the greater of:


(i) 


half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;




(ii) 


the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.





5.  

An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 364(1) and Articles 365 and 367 as the sum of non-stressed and stressed value-at-risk, which shall be calculated as follows:


(a) 


for the non-stressed value-at-risk, current parameter calibrations for expected exposure as set out in the first subparagraph of Article 292(2), shall be used;




(b) 


for the stressed value-at-risk, future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in the second subparagraph of Article 292(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters shall be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-year stress period used for the exposure parameters;




(c) 


the three-times multiplication factor used in the calculation of own funds requirements based on a value-at-risk and a stressed value-at-risk in accordance with 364(1) will apply to these calculations. EBA shall monitor for consistency any supervisory discretion used to apply a higher multiplication factor than that three-times multiplication factor to the value-at-risk and stressed value-at-risk inputs to the CVA risk charge. Competent authorities applying a multiplication factor higher than three shall provide a written justification to EBA;




(d) 


the calculation shall be carried out on at least a monthly basis and the EE that is used shall be calculated on the same frequency. If lower than a daily frequency is used, for the purpose of the calculation specified in points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of Article 364(1) institutions shall take the average over three months.





6.  
For exposures to a counterparty, for which the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments does not produce a proxy spread that is appropriate with respect to the criteria of rating, industry and region of the counterparty, the institution shall use the method set out in Article 384 to calculate the own funds requirement for CVA risk.


7.  

EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater detail:


(a) 


how a proxy spread is to be determined by the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments for the purposes of identifying si and LGDMKT referred to in paragraph 1;




(b) 


the number and size of portfolios that fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios referred to in paragraph 4.

assume a constant EE profile;




(b) 


set EE equal to the exposure value as computed under the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6, or IMM for a maturity equal to the greater of:


(i) 


half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;




(ii) 


the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.





5.  

An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 364(1) and Articles 365 and 367 as the sum of non-stressed and stressed value-at-risk, which shall be calculated as follows:


(a) 


for the non-stressed value-at-risk, current parameter calibrations for expected exposure as set out in the first subparagraph of Article 292(2), shall be used;




(b) 


for the stressed value-at-risk, future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in the second subparagraph of Article 292(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters shall be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-year stress period used for the exposure parameters;




(c) 


the three-times multiplication factor used in the calculation of own funds requirements based on a value-at-risk and a stressed value-at-risk in accordance with 364(1) will apply to these calculations. EBA shall monitor for consistency any supervisory discretion used to apply a higher multiplication factor than that three-times multiplication factor to the value-at-risk and stressed value-at-risk inputs to the CVA risk charge. Competent authorities applying a multiplication factor higher than three shall provide a written justification to EBA;




(d) 


the calculation shall be carried out on at least a monthly basis and the EE that is used shall be calculated on the same frequency. If lower than a daily frequency is used, for the purpose of the calculation specified in points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of Article 364(1) institutions shall take the average over three months.





6.  
For exposures to a counterparty, for which the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments does not produce a proxy spread that is appropriate with respect to the criteria of rating, industry and region of the counterparty, the institution shall use the method set out in Article 384 to calculate the own funds requirement for CVA risk.


7.  

EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater detail:


(a) 


how a proxy spread is to be determined by the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments for the purposes of identifying si and LGDMKT referred to in paragraph 1;




(b) 


the number and size of portfolios that fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios referred to in paragraph 4.




EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.",1839

1.  

Hedges shall be ‘eligible hedges’ for the purposes of the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Articles 383 and 384 only where they are used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk and managed as such, and are one of the following:


(a) 


single-name credit default swaps or other equivalent hedging instruments referencing the counterparty directly;




(b) 


index credit default swaps, provided that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, in the value-at-risk and the stressed value-at-risk.




The requirement in point (b) that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected in the value-at-risk and the stressed value-at-risk shall also apply to cases where a proxy is used for the spread of a counterparty.
For all counterparties for which a proxy is used, an institution shall use reasonable basis time series out of a representative group of similar names for which a spread is available.
If the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is not reflected to the satisfaction of the competent authority, then an institution shall reflect only 50 % of the notional amount of index hedges in the value-at-risk and the stressed value-at-risk.
Over-hedging of the exposures with single name credit default swaps under the method laid out in Article 383 is not allowed.

2.  
An institution shall not reflect other types of counterparty risk hedges in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk. In particular, tranched or nth-to-default credit default swaps and credit linked notes are not eligible hedges for the purposes the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk.


3.  
Eligible hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk shall not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk as set out in Title IV or treated as credit risk mitigation other than for the counterparty credit risk of the same portfolio of transaction.

Limits to large exposures

1.  An institution shall not incur an exposure to a client or group of connected clients the value of which exceeds 25 % of its Tier 1 capital, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. Where that client is an institution or an investment firm, or where a group of connected clients includes one or more institutions or investment firms, that value shall not exceed 25 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital or EUR 150 million, whichever is higher, provided that the sum of exposure values, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to all connected clients that are not institutions or investment firms, does not exceed 25 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital.Where the amount of EUR 150 million is higher than 25 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital, the value of the exposure, after having taken into account the effect of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 of this Regulation, shall not exceed a reasonable limit in terms of that institution's Tier 1 capital. That limit shall be determined by the institution in accordance with the policies and procedures referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU in order to address and control concentration risk. That limit shall not exceed 100 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital.Competent authorities may set a lower limit than EUR 150 million, in which case they shall inform EBA and the Commission thereof.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, a G-SII shall not incur an exposure to another G-SII or a non-EU G-SII, the value of which, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, exceeds 15 % of its Tier 1 capital. A G-SII shall comply with such limit no later than 12 months from the date on which it came to be identified as a G-SII. Where the G-SII has an exposure to another institution or group which comes to be identified as a G-SII or as a non-EU G-SII, it shall comply with such limit no later than 12 months from the date on which that other institution or group came to be identified as a G-SII or as a non-EU G-SII.2.  EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 as well as the outcomes of developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures at the Union and international levels, issue guidelines by 31 December 2014 to set appropriate aggregate limits to such exposures or tighter individual limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.In developing those guidelines, EBA shall consider whether the introduction of additional limits would have a material detrimental impact on the risk profile of institutions established in the Union, on the provision of credit to the real economy or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets.By 31 December 2015 the Commission shall assess the appropriateness and the impact of imposing limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework, taking into account Union and international developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures as well as credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together, if appropriate, with a legislative proposal on exposure limits to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.3.  Subject to Article 396, an institution shall at all times comply with the relevant limit laid down in paragraph 1.4.  Assets constituting claims and other exposures onto recognised third-country investment firms may be subject to the same treatment as set out in paragraph 1.5.  The limits laid down in this Article may be exceeded for the exposures in the institution's trading book, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the exposure in the non-trading book to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1, this limit being calculated with reference to Tier 1 capital, so that the excess arises entirely in the trading book;(b) the institution meets an additional own funds requirement on the part of the exposure in excess of the limit laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article which is calculated in accordance with Articles 397 and 398;(c) where 10 days or less have elapsed since the excess referred to in point (b) occurred, the trading-book exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed 500 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital;(d) any excesses that have persisted for more than 10 days do not, in aggregate, exceed 600 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital.Each time the limit has been exceeded, the institution shall report to the competent authorities without delay the amount of the excess and the name of the client concerned and, where applicable, the name of the group of connected clients concerned.6.  For the purpose of this paragraph, structural measures mean measures adopted by a Member State and implemented by the relevant competent authorities of that Member State before the entry into force of a legal act explicitly harmonising such measures, that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability.Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 400(1)(f), where Member States adopt national laws requiring structural measures to be taken within a banking group, competent authorities may require the institutions of the banking group which hold deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes ( 23 ) or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country to apply a large exposure limit below 25 % but not lower than 15 % between 28 June 2013 and 30 June 2015, and than 10 % from 1 July 2015 on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) to intragroup exposures where these exposures consist of exposures to an entity that does not belong to the same subgroup as regards the structural measures.For the purpose of this paragraph, the following conditions shall be met:(a) all entities belonging to a same subgroup as regards the structural measures are considered as one client or group of connected clients;(b) the competent authorities apply a uniform limit to the exposures referred to in the first subparagraph.Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.7.  Before adopting the specific structural measures as referred to in paragraph 6 relating to large exposures, the competent authorities shall notify the Council, the Commission, the competent authorities concerned and EBA at least two months prior to the publication of the decision to adopt the structural measures, and submit relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence of all of the following:(a) the scope of the activities that are subject to the structural measures;(b) an explanation as to why such draft measures are deemed to be suitable, effective and proportionate to protect depositors;(c) an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State.8.  The power to adopt an implementing act to accept or reject the proposed national measures referred to in paragraph 7 is conferred on the Commission acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 464(2).Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 7, EBA shall provide its opinion on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned. Competent authorities concerned may also provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust and strong evidence that the measures have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits, the Commission shall, within two months of receiving the notification, reject the proposed national measures. Otherwise, the Commission shall accept the proposed national measures for an initial period of 2 years and where appropriate the measures may be subject to amendment.The Commission shall only reject the proposed national measures if it considers the proposed national measures entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market or to the free movement of capital in accordance with the provisions of the TFEU.The assessment of the Commission shall take account of the opinion of EBA and shall take into account the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 7.Before the expiry of the measures, the competent authorities may propose new measures for the extension of the period of application for an additional period of 2 years each time. In this case, they shall notify the Commission, the Council, the competent authorities concerned and EBA. Approval of the new measures shall be subject to the process set out in this Article. This Article shall be without prejudice to Article 458.Footnotes

A G-SII shall comply with such limit no later than 12 months from the date on which it came to be identified as a G-SII.

1.  For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, institutions may, except where prohibited by applicable national law, reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure that is fully secured by residential property in accordance with Article 125(1) by the pledged amount of the market value or mortgage lending value of the property concerned, but by not more than 50 % of the market value or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a risk weight higher than 35 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by residential property in accordance with Article 124(2);(b) the exposure or part of the exposure is fully secured by any of the following:(i) one or more mortgages on residential property; or(ii) a residential property in a leasing transaction under which the lessor retains full ownership of the residential property and the lessee has not yet exercised his or her option to purchase;(c) the requirements laid down in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met.2.  For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may, except where prohibited by applicable national law, reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure that is fully secured by commercial immovable property in accordance with Article 126(1) by the pledged amount of the market value or mortgage lending value of the property concerned, but not by more than 50 % of the market value or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a risk weight higher than 50 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by commercial immovable property in accordance with Article 124(2);(b) the exposure is fully secured by any of the following:(i) one or more mortgages on offices or other commercial premises; or(ii) one or more offices or other commercial premises and the exposures related to property leasing transactions;(c) the requirements in point (a) of Article 126(2) and in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;(d) the commercial immovable property is fully constructed.3.  An institution may treat an exposure to a counterparty that results from a reverse repurchase agreement under which the institution has purchased from the counterparty non-accessory independent mortgage liens on immovable property of third parties as a number of individual exposures to each of those third parties, provided that all of the following conditions are met:(a) the counterparty is an institution or an investment firm;(b) the exposure is fully secured by liens on the immovable property of those third parties that have been purchased by the institution and the institution is able to exercise those liens;(c) the institution has ensured that the requirements in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;(d) the institution becomes beneficiary of the claims that the counterparty has against the third parties in the event of default, insolvency or liquidation of the counterparty;(e) the institution reports to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 394 the total amount of exposures to each other institution or investment firm that are treated in accordance with this paragraph.For these purposes, the institution shall assume that it has an exposure to each of those third parties for the amount of the claim that the counterparty has on the third party instead of the corresponding amount of the exposure to the counterparty. The remainder of the exposure to the counter party, if any, shall continue to be treated as an exposure to the counter party.Footnotes

1.  Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party or is secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution shall:(a) treat the portion of the exposure which is guaranteed as exposure to the guarantor rather than to the client, provided that the unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned a risk weight that is equal to or lower than the risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three;(b) treat the portion of the exposure collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral as exposure to the third party rather than to the client, provided that the exposure is secured by collateral and provided that the collateralised portion of the exposure would be assigned a risk weight that is equal to or lower than the risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three.The approach referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be used by an institution where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection.For the purposes of this Part, an institution may use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph only where it is permitted to use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the Financial Collateral Simple Method for the purposes of Article 92.2.  Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1, the institution:(a) where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated, shall calculate the amount of the exposure that is deemed to be covered in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection set out in Part Three;(b) shall treat any mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three;(c) may recognise partial coverage in accordance with the treatment set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three.3.  For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the amount in point (a) of this paragraph with the amount in point (b) of this paragraph, provided that the conditions set out in points (c), (d) and (e) of this paragraph are met:(a) the total amount of the institution's exposure to a collateral issuer due to tri-party repurchase agreements facilitated by a tri-party agent;(b) the full amount of the limits that the institution has instructed the tri-party agent referred to in point (a) to apply to the securities issued by the collateral issuer referred to in that point;(c) the institution has verified that the tri-party agent has in place appropriate safeguards to prevent breaches of the limits referred to in point (b);(d) the competent authority has not expressed to the institution any material concerns;(e) the sum of the amount of the limit referred to in point (b) of this paragraph and any other exposures of the institution to the collateral issuer does not exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1).4.  EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying the conditions for the application of the treatment referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, including the conditions and frequency for determining, monitoring and revising the limits referred to in point (b) of that paragraph.EBA shall publish those guidelines by 31 December 2019. Footnotes

Liquidity coverage requirement

1.  Institutions shall hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity buffers which are adequate to face any possible imbalance between liquidity inflows and outflows under gravely stressed conditions over a period of thirty days. During times of stress, institutions may use their liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows.2.  Institutions shall not double count liquidity outflows, liquidity inflows and liquid assets.Unless specified otherwise in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), where an item can be counted in more than one outflow category, it shall be counted in the outflow category that produces the greatest contractual outflow for that item.3.  Institutions may use the liquid assets referred to in paragraph 1 to meet their obligations under stressed circumstances as specified under Article 414.4.  The provisions set out in Title II shall apply exclusively for the purposes of specifying reporting obligations set out in Article 415.4a.  The delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall apply to institutions.5.  Member States may maintain or introduce national provisions in the area of liquidity requirements before binding minimum standards for liquidity coverage requirements are specified and fully introduced in the Union in accordance with Article 460. Member States or competent authorities may require domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions, to maintain a higher liquidity coverage requirement up to 100 % until the binding minimum standard is fully introduced at a rate of 100 % in accordance with Article 460.Footnotes

Reporting on liquid assets

1.  Institutions shall report the following as liquid assets unless excluded by paragraph 2 and only if the liquid assets fulfil the conditions in paragraph 3:(a) cash and exposures to central banks to the extent that these exposures can be withdrawn at any time in times of stress. As regards deposits held with central banks, the competent authority and the central bank shall aim at reaching a common understanding regarding the extent to which minimum reserves can be withdrawn in times of stress;(b) other transferable assets that are of extremely high liquidity and credit quality;(c) transferable assets representing claims on or guaranteed by:(i) the central government of a Member State, a region with fiscal autonomy to raise and collect taxes, or of a third country in the domestic currency of the central or regional government, if the institution incurs a liquidity risk in that Member State or third country that it covers by holding those liquid assets;(ii) central banks and non-central government public sector entities in the domestic currency of the central bank and the public sector entity;(iii) the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Commission and multilateral development banks;(iv) the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism;(d) transferable assets that are of high liquidity and credit quality;(e) standby credit facilities granted by central banks within the scope of monetary policy to the extent that these facilities are not collateralised by liquid assets and excluding emergency liquidity assistance;(f) if the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions, the legal or statutory minimum deposits with the central credit institution and other statutory or contractually available liquid funding from the central credit institution or institutions that are members of the network referred to in Article 113(7), or eligible for the waiver provided in Article 10, to the extent that this funding is not collateralised by liquid assets.Pending specification of a uniform definition in accordance with Article 460 of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality, institutions shall identify themselves in a given currency transferable assets that are respectively of high or extremely high liquidity and credit quality. Pending specification of a uniform definition, competent authorities may, taking into account the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5) provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying assets of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality. In the absence of such guidance, institutions shall use transparent and objective criteria to this end, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).2.  The following shall not be considered liquid assets:(a) assets that are issued by a credit institution unless they fulfil one of the following conditions:(i) they are bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) or asset backed instruments if demonstrated to be of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509 (3), (4) and (5);(ii) they are covered bonds as defined in point (1) Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 other than those referred to in point (i) of this point;(iii) the credit institution has been set up by a Member State central or regional government and that government has an obligation to protect the economic basis of the institution and maintain its viability throughout its lifetime; or the asset is explicitly guaranteed by that government; or at least 90 % of the loans granted by the institution are directly or indirectly guaranteed by that government and the asset is predominantly used to fund promotional loans granted on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote that government's public policy objectives;(b) assets that are provided as collateral to the institution under reverse repo and securities financing transactions and that are held by the institution only as a credit risk mitigant and that are not legally and contractually available for use by the institution;(c) assets issued by any of the following:(i) an investment firm;(ii) an insurance undertaking;(iii) a financial holding company;(iv) a mixed financial holding company;(v) any other entity that performs one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU as its main business.3.  In accordance with paragraph 1, institutions shall report assets that fulfil the following conditions as liquid assets:(a) the assets are unencumbered or stand available within collateral pools to be used for obtaining additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution;(b) the assets are not issued by the institution itself, by its parent or subsidiary institutions, or by another subsidiary of its parent institution or parent financial holding company;(c) the price of the assets is generally agreed upon by market participants and can easily be observed in the market or the price can be determined by a formula that is easy to calculate on the basis of publicly available inputs and that does not depend on strong assumptions, as is typically the case for structured or exotic products;(d) the assets are listed on a recognised exchange or they are tradable by an outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on repurchase markets; those criteria shall be assessed separately for each market.The conditions referred to in points (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the assets referred to in points (a), (e) and (f) of paragraph 1.4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, pending the specification of a binding liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460 and in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report on:(a) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets such as equities and gold based on transparent and objective criteria, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);(b) other central bank eligible and tradable assets such as asset backed instruments of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);(c) other central bank eligible but non-tradable assets such as credit claims as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).5.  Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets, up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million or the equivalent amount in domestic currency, in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution, provided that the requirements laid down in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk.The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible for the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets.6.  Where a liquid asset ceases to comply with the requirement for liquid assets as set out in this Article, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 5, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days, provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.Footnotes

(a) 


0 % for the assets referred to in point (a) of Article 416(1);




(b) 


5 % for the assets referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);

Pending the specification of a liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460, liquidity outflows to be reported shall include:


(a) 


the current amount outstanding for retail deposits as set out in Article 421;




(b) 


the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout by the issuing institutions or by the provider of the funding or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 422;




(c) 


the additional outflows referred to in Article 423;




(d) 


the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities, as set out in Article 424;




(e) 


the additional outflows identified in the assessment in accordance with paragraph 2.





2.  
Institutions shall regularly assess the likelihood and potential volume of liquidity outflows during the next 30 days as far as products or services are concerned, which are not captured in Articles 422, 423 and 424 and which they offer or sponsor or which potential purchasers would consider to be associated with them, including but not limited to liquidity outflows resulting from any contractual arrangements such as other off-balance sheet and contingent funding obligations, including, but not limited to committed funding facilities, un-drawn loans and advances to wholesale counterparties, mortgages that have been agreed but not yet drawn down, credit cards, overdrafts, planned outflows related to renewal or extension of new retail or wholesale loans, planned derivative payables and trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and in Annex I. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.

For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Institutions shall report not less than annually to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in the first subparagraph are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I.

1.  Institutions shall separately report the amount of retail deposits covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country, and multiply by at least 5 % where the deposit is either of the following:(a) part of an established relationship making withdrawal highly unlikely;(b) held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited.2.  Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10 %.3.  Taking into account the behaviour of local depositors as advised by competent authorities, EBA shall issue guidelines by 1 January 2014 on the criteria to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identification of retail deposits subject to different outflows and the definitions of those products for purposes of this Title. Those guidelines shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.4.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in those paragraphs if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.5.  Institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the institution rigorously applies the following for the whole category of those deposits, unless in individually justified circumstances of hardship for the depositor:(a) within 30 days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit; or(b) for early withdrawals within 30 days, the depositor has to pay a penalty that includes the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and the contractual maturity date plus a material penalty that does not have to exceed the interest due for the time elapsed between the date of deposit and the date of withdrawal.Footnotes

Outflows on other liabilities


1.  
Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from the institution's own operating expenses by 0 %.


2.  

Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 by:


(a) 


0 % up to the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418 if they are collateralised by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;




(b) 


100 % over the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418, if they are collateralized by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;




(c) 


100 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416, with the exception of transactions covered by points (d) and (e) of this paragraph;




(d) 


25 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 and the lender is the central government, a public sector entity of the Member State in which the credit institution has been authorised or has established a branch, or a multilateral development bank. Public sector entities that receive that treatment shall be limited to those that have a risk weight of 20 % or lower in accordance with Chapter 2, Title II of Part Three;




(e) 


0 % if the lender is a central bank.





3.  

Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits that have to be maintained:


(a) 


by the depositor in order to obtain clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services from the institution;




(b) 


in the context of common task sharing within an institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7) or as a legal or statutory minimum deposit by another entity being a Member of the same institutional protection scheme;




(c) 


by the depositor in the context of an established operational relationship other than that mentioned in point (a);




(d) 


by the depositor to obtain cash clearing and central credit institution services and where the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions;


by 5 % in the case of point (a) to the extent to which they are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country and by 25 % otherwise.


Deposits from credit institutions placed at central credit institutions that are considered as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416(1)(f) shall be multiplied by 100 % outflow rate.

4.  
Clearing, custody, cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 shall only cover those services to the extent that those services are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependence. Those services shall not merely consist of correspondent banking or prime brokerage services, and institutions shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning.

Pending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria for identifying an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning and shall report those criteria to the competent authorities. In the absence of a uniform definition, competent authorities may provide general guidance that institutions are to follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.

5.  
Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits by clients that are not financial customers to the extent they do not fall under paragraphs 3 and 4 by 40 % and shall multiply the amount of these liabilities covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent Deposit Guarantee Scheme in a third country by 20 %.


6.  
Institutions shall take outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II into account on a net basis across counterparties and shall multiply them by 100 % in the case of a net outflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.


7.  
Institutions shall separately report other liabilities that do not fall under paragraphs 1 to 5.


8.  

Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7 on a case-by-case basis, provided that all the following conditions are met:


(a) 


the counterparty is any of the following:


(i) 


a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution, or a parent or subsidiary investment firm of the institution, or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or parent investment firm;




(ii) 


the counterparty is linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;




(iii) 


an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7); or




(iv) 


the central institution or a member of a network compliant with point (d) of Article 400(2);






(b) 


there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario;




(c) 


a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Article 425;




(d) 


the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.





9.  
Competent authorities may waive the conditions set out in point (d) of paragraph 8 where point (b) of Article 20(1) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in point (b) of Article 20(1). The fulfilment of the conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.

1.  
Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416. The collateral to be provided shall not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given the counterparty's own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over the next 30 days.


2.  
The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 5 % if they qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk.


3.  

The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions:


(a) 


they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk;




(b) 


they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers;




(c) 


they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets.





4.  
The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 %, provided that the committed amount exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and that the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.


5.  

The institutions shall report the maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days. This applies in particular to the following:


(a) 


liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3;




(b) 


arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE;




(c) 


facilities extended to credit institutions;




(d) 


facilities extended to financial institutions and investment firms.





6.  
By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those paragraphs. By way of derogation from point (g) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another institution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed.

This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416. The collateral to be provided shall not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given the counterparty's own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over the next 30 days.


2.  
The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 5 % if they qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk.


3.  

The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions:


(a) 


they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk;




(b) 


they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers;




(c) 


they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets.





4.  
The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 %, provided that the committed amount exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and that the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.


5.  

The institutions shall report the maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days. This applies in particular to the following:


(a) 


liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3;




(b) 


arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE;




(c) 


facilities extended to credit institutions;




(d) 


facilities extended to financial institutions and investment firms.





6.  
By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those paragraphs. By way of derogation from point (g) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another institution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed.

Inflows


1.  
Institutions shall report their liquidity inflows. Liquidity inflows shall be capped at 75 % of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions that qualify for the treatment set out in Article 113(6) or (7) of this Regulation from that cap.

Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from monies due from borrowers and bond investors where those inflows are related to mortgage lending funded by bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) or (6) of this Regulation or by covered bonds as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 from that cap. Institutions may exempt inflows from promotional loans that the institutions have passed through. Subject to the prior approval of the competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis, the institution may fully or partially exempt inflows where the liquidity provider is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution, a parent or subsidiary investment firm of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or parent investment firm or is related to the institution as set out in Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU.

2.  

The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the institution has no reason to expect non-performance within the 30-day time horizon. Liquidity inflows shall be reported in full with the following inflows reported separately:


(a) 


monies due from customers that are not financial customers for the purposes of principal payment shall be reduced by 50 % of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 as referred to in point (d) of this paragraph.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point, institutions that have received a commitment referred to in Article 424(6) in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans;




(b) 


monies due from trade financing transactions referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 162(3) with a residual maturity of up to 30 days, shall be taken into account in full as inflows;




(c) 


loans with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow, provided that the contract allows the institution to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;




(d) 


monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due;




(e) 


monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow;




(f) 


monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided that there is no double counting with liquid assets;




(g) 


any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account.





3.  
Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.


4.  

By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:


(a) 


there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider;




(b) 


the counterparty is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC or a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation or the central institution or a member of a network that is subject to the waiver referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;




(c) 


a corresponding symmetric or more conservative outflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Articles 422, 423 and 424;




(d) 


the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.





5.  
Competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 4 where Article 20(1)(b) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such higher inflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in Article 20(1)(b). Fulfilment of the conditions for such higher inflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.


6.  
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 5.

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

7.  
Institutions shall not report inflows from any of the liquid assets reported in accordance with Article 416 other than payments due on the assets that are not reflected in the market value of the asset.


8.  
Institutions shall not report inflows from any new obligations entered into.


9.  
Institutions shall take liquidity inflows which are to be received in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies into account only to the extent that they correspond to outflows respectively in the third country or currency in question.

Calculation of the amount of required stable funding

1.  Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.2.  Assets which institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding where those assets are accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution and the institution does not have beneficial ownership of the asset.Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 where those assets are not accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution but the institution does have beneficial ownership of the assets.3.  Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions over which the institution retains beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, even where the assets do not remain on the balance sheet of the institution. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.4.  Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.5.  Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that asset is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction in relation to which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered, provided that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.6.  The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:(a) assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded, credit lines that are available to the institution; those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with a central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme; institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;(b) assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;(c) assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance.7.  In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:(a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 428ad and from point (a) of Article 428ah(1), assets encumbered for the purposes of the operations referred to in this subparagraph;(b) by way of derogation from points (d)(i) and (d)(ii) of Article 428ad, from point (b) of Article 428af and from point (c) of Article 428ag, monies that result from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets as referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and shall take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.8.  In order to avoid any double counting, institutions shall exclude assets that are associated with collateral that is recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and 428ah(2), recognised as initial margin posted, or recognised as a contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter.9.  Institutions shall include foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments. They shall exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.10.  Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.Competent authorities shall report the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors to EBA at least once a year.

Residual maturity of an asset

Residual maturity of a liability or own funds


1.  
Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.


2.  
Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.

Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.


4.  
In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, for liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year, shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.

Simplified calculation of the amount of required stable funding


1.  
Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, for small and non-complex institutions the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.


2.  
Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.

Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are not accounted for in their balance sheet but on which they have beneficial ownership shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.

3.  
Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions, over which they retain beneficial ownership, even where they do not remain on their balance sheet, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.


4.  
Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.

Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.

5.  
Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.


6.  

The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:


(a) 


assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution, including assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme;




(b) 


assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;




(c) 


assets attached as non-mandatory over-collateralisation to a covered bond issuance.




For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer.

7.  

In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:


(a) 


by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (a) of Article 428az(1), assets encumbered for the operations referred to in this subparagraph;




(b) 


by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (b) of Article 428ay, monies resulting from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.




Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.
When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.

8.  
Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and Article 428ah(2) or as initial margin posted or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double counting.


9.  
Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.


10.  
Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.

Competent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.","Author: EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (EBA); Title: Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR); PART SIX: LIQUIDITY; TITLE IV: THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO; Article 428aq: Simplified calculation of the amount of required stable funding; Content:

Residual maturity of an asset


1.  
Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.


2.  
Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.


3.  
When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.


4.  
In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portions that mature in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.

amount in the total exposure measure, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the granting of the loan is conditional upon the opening of the savings account at the institution granting the loan and both the loan and the savings account are regulated by the same sectoral law;(b) the balance on the savings account cannot be withdrawn, in part or in full, by the debtor for the entire duration of the loan;(c) the institution can unconditionally and irrevocably use the balance on the savings account to settle any claim originating under the loan agreement in cases regulated by the sectoral law referred to in point (a), including the case of non-payment by or the insolvency of the debtor.‘Pre-financing loan’ or ‘intermediate loan’ means a loan that is granted to the borrower for

2.  
In addition to the calculation laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.

Institutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.

3.  

Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives, provided that all the following conditions are met:


(a) 


the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;




(b) 


the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;




(c) 


the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to Specific Wrong-Way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);




(d) 


where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution's Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;




(e) 


the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the total exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 429a(1), as applicable.




For the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the total exposure measure.

4.  
For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3, ‘material term’ means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative. Two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity.


5.  
By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same.


6.  
Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital.


7.  
In the case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 3 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.

Reporting on prudential requirements and financial information

Draft Implementing Technical Standards

1.  Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on:(a) own funds requirements, including the leverage ratio, as set out in Article 92 and Part Seven;(b) the requirements laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, for institutions that are subject to those requirements;(c) large exposures as set out in Article 394;(d) liquidity requirements as set out in Article 415;(e) the aggregate data for each national immovable property market as set out in Article 430a(1);(f) the requirements and guidance set out in Directive 2013/36/EU qualified for standardised reporting, except for any additional reporting requirement under point (j) of Article 104(1) of that Directive;(g) the level of asset encumbrance, including a breakdown by the type of asset encumbrance, such as repurchase agreements, securities lending, securitised exposures or loans.Institutions exempted in accordance with Article 6(5) shall not be subject to the reporting requirement on the leverage ratio set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph on an individual basis.1a.  For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, when institutions report on own funds requirements on securitisations, the information they report shall include information on NPE securitisations benefitting from the treatment set out in Article 269a, on STS on-balance sheet securitisations that they originate, and on the breakdown of the assets underlying those STS on-balance sheet securitisations by asset class.2.  In addition to the reporting on the leverage ratio referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in order to enable the competent authorities to monitor leverage ratio volatility, in particular around reporting reference dates, large institutions shall report specific components of the leverage ratio to their competent authorities based on averages over the reporting period and the data used to calculate those averages.3.  In addition to the reporting on prudential requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report financial information to their competent authorities where they are one of the following:(a) an institution that is subject to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;(b) a credit institution that prepares its consolidated accounts in accordance with the international accounting standards pursuant to point (b) of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.4.  Competent authorities may require credit institutions that determine their own funds on a consolidated basis in accordance with international accounting standards pursuant to Article 24(2) to report financial information in accordance with this Article.5.  The reporting on financial information referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall only comprise information that is needed to provide a comprehensive view of the institution's risk profile and the systemic risks posed by the institution to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.6.  The reporting requirements laid down in this Article shall be applied to institutions in a proportionate manner taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 8, having regard to their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities.7.  EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the uniform reporting formats and templates, the instructions and methodology on how to use those templates, the frequency and dates of reporting, the definitions and the IT solutions for the reporting referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4.Any new reporting requirements set out in such implementing technical standards shall not be applicable earlier than six months from the date of their entry into force.For the purposes of paragraph 2, the draft implementing technical standards shall specify which components of the leverage ratio shall be reported using day-end or month-end values. For that purpose, EBA shall take into account both of the following:(a) how susceptible a component is to significant temporary reductions in transaction volumes that could result in an underrepresentation of the risk of excessive leverage at the reporting reference date;(b) developments and findings at international level.EBA shall submit to the Commission the draft implementing technical standards referred to in this paragraph by 28 June 2021, except in relation to the following:(a) the leverage ratio, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020;(b) the obligations laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.8.  EBA shall assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 ( 25 ) in accordance with this paragraph and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. That assessment shall be carried out in particular in relation to small and non-complex institutions. For those purposes, the report shall:(a) classify institutions into categories based on their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities;(b) measure the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions during the relevant period to meet the reporting requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, taking into account the following principles:(i) the reporting costs shall be measured as the ratio of the reporting costs relative to the institution's total costs during the relevant period;(ii) the reporting costs shall comprise all expenditure related to the implementation and operation on an on-going basis of the reporting systems, including expenditure on staff, IT systems, legal, accounting, auditing and consultancy services;(iii) the relevant period shall refer to each annual period during which institutions have incurred reporting costs to prepare for the implementation of the reporting requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and to continue operating the reporting systems on an on-going basis;(c) assess whether the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered by the reporting requirements for the purposes of prudential supervision;(d) assess the effects of a reduction of reporting requirement on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and(e) make recommendations on how to reduce reporting requirements at least for small and non-complex institutions, to which end EBA shall target an expected average cost reduction of at least 10 % but ideally a 20 % cost reduction. EBA shall, in particular, assess whether:(i) the reporting requirements referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 could be waived for small and non-complex institutions where asset encumbrance was below a certain threshold;(ii) the reporting frequency required in accordance with points (a), (c), and (g) of paragraph 1 could be reduced for small and non-complex institutions.EBA shall accompany that report by draft implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7.9.  Competent authorities shall consult EBA on whether institutions, other than those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, should report on financial information on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 3, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the relevant institutions are not already reporting on a consolidated basis;(b) the relevant institutions are subject to an accounting framework in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC;(c) financial reporting is considered necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the risk profile of those institutions' activities and of the systemic risks they pose to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the formats and templates that institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall use for the purposes set out therein.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.10.  Where a competent authority considers information not covered by the implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7 as necessary for the purposes set out in paragraph 5, it shall notify EBA and the ESRB of the additional information it considers necessary to include in the implementing technical standards referred to in that paragraph.11.  Competent authorities may waive the requirement to submit any of the data points set out in the reporting templates specified in the implementing technical standards referred to in this Article where those data points are duplicative. For those purposes, duplicative data points shall refer to any data points which are already available to the competent authorities by means other than by collecting those reporting templates, including where those data points can be obtained from data that is already available to the competent authorities in different formats or levels of granularity; the competent authority may only grant the waivers referred to in this paragraph if data received, collated or aggregated through such alternative methods are identical to those data points which would otherwise have to be reported in accordance with the respective implementing technical standards.Competent authorities, resolution authorities and designated authorities shall make use of data exchange wherever possible to reduce reporting requirements. The provisions on the exchange of information and professional secrecy as laid down in Section II of Chapter I of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU shall apply.Footnotes

underrepresentation of the risk of excessive leverage at the reporting reference date;(b) developments and findings at international level.EBA shall submit to the Commission the draft implementing technical standards referred to in this paragraph by 28 June 2021, except in relation to the following:(a) the leverage ratio, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020;(b) the obligations laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.8.  EBA shall assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 ( 25 ) in accordance with this paragraph and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. That assessment shall be carried out in particular in relation to small and non-complex institutions. For those purposes, the report shall:(a) classify institutions into categories based on their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities;(b) measure the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions during the relevant period to meet the reporting requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, taking into account the following principles:(i) the reporting costs shall be measured as the ratio of the reporting costs relative to the institution's total costs during the relevant period;(ii) the reporting costs shall comprise all expenditure related to the implementation and operation on an on-going basis of the reporting systems, including expenditure on staff, IT systems, legal, accounting, auditing and consultancy services;(iii) the relevant period shall refer to each annual period during which institutions have incurred reporting costs to prepare for the implementation of the reporting requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and to continue operating the reporting systems on an on-going basis;(c) assess whether the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered by the reporting requirements for the purposes of prudential supervision;(d) assess the effects of a reduction of reporting requirement on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and(e) make recommendations on how to reduce reporting requirements at least for small and non-complex institutions, to which end EBA shall target an expected average cost reduction of at least 10 % but ideally a 20 % cost reduction. EBA shall, in particular, assess whether:(i) the reporting requirements referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 could be waived for small and non-complex institutions where asset encumbrance was below a certain threshold;(ii) the reporting frequency required in accordance with points (a), (c), and (g) of paragraph 1 could be reduced for small and non-complex institutions.EBA shall accompany that report by draft implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7.9.  Competent authorities shall consult EBA on whether institutions, other than those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, should report on financial information on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 3, provided that all the following conditions are met:(a) the relevant institutions are not already reporting on a consolidated basis;(b) the relevant institutions are subject to an accounting framework in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC;(c) financial reporting is considered necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the risk profile of those institutions' activities and of the systemic risks they pose to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the formats and templates that institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall use for the purposes set out therein.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.10.  Where a competent authority considers information not covered by the implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7 as necessary for the purposes set out in paragraph 5, it shall notify EBA and the ESRB of the additional information it considers necessary to include in the implementing technical standards referred to in that paragraph.11.  Competent authorities may waive the requirement to submit any of the data points set out in the reporting templates specified in the implementing technical standards referred to in this Article where those data points are duplicative. For those purposes, duplicative data points shall refer to any data points which are already available to the competent authorities by means other than by collecting those reporting templates, including where those data points can be obtained from data that is already available to the competent authorities in different formats or levels of granularity; the competent authority may only grant the waivers referred to in this paragraph if data received, collated or aggregated through such alternative methods are identical to those data points which would otherwise have to be reported in accordance with the respective implementing technical standards.Competent authorities, resolution authorities and designated authorities shall make use of data exchange wherever possible to reduce reporting requirements. The provisions on the exchange of information and professional secrecy as laid down in Section II of Chapter I of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU shall apply.Footnotes

Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article identifies changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State and which that authority considers that cannot be addressed by means of other macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU as effectively as by implementing stricter national measures, it shall notify the Commission and the ESRB accordingly. The ESRB shall forward the notification to the European Parliament, to the Council and to EBA without delay.

The notification shall be accompanied by the following documents and include, where appropriate, relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence on:


(a) 


the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk;




(b) 


the reasons why such changes could pose a threat to financial stability at national level or to the real economy;




(c) 


an explanation as to why the authority considers that the macroprudential tools set out in Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 133 and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU would be less suitable and effective to deal with those risks than the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of this paragraph;

(iii) 


liquidity requirements laid down in Part Six;




(iv) 


risk weights for targeting asset bubbles in the residential property and commercial immovable property sector;

(e) 


an explanation as to why the draft measures are considered by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1 to be suitable, effective and proportionate to address the situation; and




(f) 


an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the draft measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State concerned.



3.  
When authorised to apply national measures in accordance with this Article, the authorities determined in accordance with paragraph 1 shall provide relevant competent authorities or designated authorities in other Member States with all relevant information.


4.  
The power to adopt an implementing act to reject the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of paragraph 2 is conferred on the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission.

Within one month of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the matters referred to in points (a) to (f) of that paragraph to the Council, to the Commission and to the Member State concerned.
Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.
In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.
The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.
The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not met:


(a) 


the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;




(b) 


the macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are less suitable or effective than the draft national measures to deal with the macroprudential or systemic risk identified;




(c) 


the draft national measures do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market; and




(d) 


the issue concerns only one Member State.


The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1.
In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month of receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State concerned may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.

5.  
Other Member States may recognise the measures adopted in accordance with this Article and apply them to domestically authorised institutions, which have branches or have exposures located in the Member State authorised to apply the measure.


6.  
Where Member States recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, they shall notify the Council, the Commission, EBA, the ESRB and the Member State authorised to apply the measures.


7.  
When deciding whether to recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, the Member State shall take into consideration the criteria set in paragraph 4.


8.  
The Member State authorised to apply the measures may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which do not recognise the measures.


9.  
Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State concerned shall, in consultation with the ESRB and EBA, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for up to two additional years each time. After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least every two years thereafter.


10.  
Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9 of this Article, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided for in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (d)(iv) and (d)(vii) of paragraph 2 of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.

Liquidity requirements


1.  
EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 415(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, non-financial end-users, the banking industry, competent authorities and the ESCB central banks, annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission on whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Part Six based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes.

The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall take due account of markets and international regulatory developments as well as of the interactions of the liquidity coverage requirement with other prudential requirements under this Regulation such as the risk-based capital ratios as set out in Article 92 and the leverage ratio.
The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on the report referred to in the first subparagraph.

2.  

EBA shall, in the report referred to in paragraph 1, assess the following, in particular:


(a) 


the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its application, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing;




(b) 


the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2);




(c) 


the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account international regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);




(d) 


the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State;




(e) 


the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %;




(f) 


the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons;




(g) 


the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments;




(h) 


derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject;




(i) 


the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah-compliant banks;




(j) 


the definition of circumstances of stress, including principles for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance;




(k) 


the definition of an established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c);




(l) 


the calibration of the outflow rate applicable to correspondent banking and prime brokerage services as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 422(4);




(m) 


mechanisms for the grandfathering of government guaranteed bonds issued to credit institutions as part of government support measures with Union State aid approval, such as bonds issued by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in Ireland and by the Spanish Asset Management Company in Spain, designed to remove problem assets from the balance sheets of credit institutions, as assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality until at least December 2023.





3.  
EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1).

other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, such as local government bonds and commercial paper; and




(c) 


other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, such as equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets.



4.  
The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall consider whether, and if so to what extent, standby credit facilities referred to in point (e) of Article 416(1) should be included as liquid assets in light of international development and taking into account European specificities, including the way monetary policy is performed in the Union.

EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions:

(a) 


uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality;




(b) 


the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which:


(i) 


a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise institutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations;




(ii) 


regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions from lending or borrowing on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation;




(iii) 


the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments;






(c) 


the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article 417, in line with international regulatory developments.

Net Stable Funding Requirements


1.  
By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending. In particular EBA shall analyse the impact of stable sources of funding on the refinancing structures of different banking models in the Union.


2.  

By 31 December 2015, EBA shall also report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III and, in accordance with the uniform reporting formats referred to in point (a) of Article 415(3) and after consulting the ESRB, on methodologies for determining the amount of stable funding available to and required by institutions and on appropriate uniform definitions for calculating such a net stable funding requirement, examining in particular the following:


(a) 


the categories and weightings applied to sources of stable funding in Article 427(1);




(b) 


the categories and weightings applied to determine the requirement for stable funding in Article 428(1);




(c) 


methodologies shall provide incentives and disincentives as appropriate to encourage a more stable longer term funding of assets, business activities, investment and funding of institutions;




(d) 


the need to develop different methodologies for different types of institutions.





3.  
By 31 December 2016, the Commission shall, if appropriate, taking into account the reports referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, and taking full account of the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council on how to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding.


4.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of required stable funding covering the funding risk linked to the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio, in particular the future funding risk for those derivative contracts set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2), and report to the Commission on the opportunity to adopt a higher required stable funding factor or a more risk-sensitive measure by 28 June 2024. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;




(b) 


the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);




(c) 


the opportunity to change more broadly the treatment of derivative contracts in the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, as set out in Article 428d, Articles 428k(4) and 428s(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag, Articles 428ah(2), 428al(4) and 428at(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ay and Article 428az(2), to better capture the funding risk linked to those contracts over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;




(d) 


the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions' derivative contracts.





5.  
If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


6.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;




(b) 


the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;




(c) 


the opportunity to apply stable funding factors to off-balance-sheet items used in securities financing transactions as an alternative to the treatment set out in Article 428p(5);




(d) 


the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;




(e) 


the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers, on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds;




(f) 


the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for those institutions' transactions, in particular for securities financing transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers where sovereign bonds are received as collateral in those transactions.





7.  
By 28 June 2024, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 6, any international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions, including of the assets received or given in those transactions, and the treatment of unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


8.  
By 28 June 2025, the required stable funding factors applied to the transactions referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (b) of Article 428s(1) and in point (a) of Article 428v, shall be raised from 0 % to 10 %, from 5 % to 15 % and from 10 % to 15 % respectively, unless otherwise specified in a legislative act adopted on the basis of a proposal by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.


9.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts. EBA shall report on the appropriateness of the treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the possible impact of the treatment on investors' ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;




(b) 


the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;




(c) 


the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.





10.  
By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


11.  
EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.

By 31 December 2015, EBA shall also report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III and, in accordance with the uniform reporting formats referred to in point (a) of Article 415(3) and after consulting the ESRB, on methodologies for determining the amount of stable funding available to and required by institutions and on appropriate uniform definitions for calculating such a net stable funding requirement, examining in particular the following:


(a) 


the categories and weightings applied to sources of stable funding in Article 427(1);




(b) 


the categories and weightings applied to determine the requirement for stable funding in Article 428(1);




(c) 


methodologies shall provide incentives and disincentives as appropriate to encourage a more stable longer term funding of assets, business activities, investment and funding of institutions;




(d) 


the need to develop different methodologies for different types of institutions.





3.  
By 31 December 2016, the Commission shall, if appropriate, taking into account the reports referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, and taking full account of the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council on how to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding.


4.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of required stable funding covering the funding risk linked to the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio, in particular the future funding risk for those derivative contracts set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2), and report to the Commission on the opportunity to adopt a higher required stable funding factor or a more risk-sensitive measure by 28 June 2024. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;




(b) 


the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);




(c) 


the opportunity to change more broadly the treatment of derivative contracts in the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, as set out in Article 428d, Articles 428k(4) and 428s(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag, Articles 428ah(2), 428al(4) and 428at(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ay and Article 428az(2), to better capture the funding risk linked to those contracts over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;




(d) 


the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions' derivative contracts.





5.  
If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


6.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;




(b) 


the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;




(c) 


the opportunity to apply stable funding factors to off-balance-sheet items used in securities financing transactions as an alternative to the treatment set out in Article 428p(5);




(d) 


the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;




(e) 


the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers, on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds;




(f) 


the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for those institutions' transactions, in particular for securities financing transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers where sovereign bonds are received as collateral in those transactions.





7.  
By 28 June 2024, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 6, any international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions, including of the assets received or given in those transactions, and the treatment of unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


8.  
By 28 June 2025, the required stable funding factors applied to the transactions referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (b) of Article 428s(1) and in point (a) of Article 428v, shall be raised from 0 % to 10 %, from 5 % to 15 % and from 10 % to 15 % respectively, unless otherwise specified in a legislative act adopted on the basis of a proposal by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.


9.  

EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts. EBA shall report on the appropriateness of the treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:


(a) 


the possible impact of the treatment on investors' ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;




(b) 


the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;




(c) 


the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.





10.  
By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


11.  
EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.

(e) 


whether the leverage ratio buffer requirement as referred to in Article 92(1a) should be extended to systemically important institutions other than G-SIIs, whether its calibration should be different from the calibration for G-SIIs, and whether its calibration should depend on the level of systemic importance of the institution;

Article 50b
General rules for the calculation of KCCP

For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), the following shall apply:


(a) 


a CCP shall calculate the value of the exposures it has to its clearing members as follows:


(i) 


for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof;




(ii) 


for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation. The exception set out in point (a) of Article 285(3) of that Regulation, shall not apply;




(iii) 


for exposures arising from transactions not listed in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which entails settlement risk only it shall calculate them in accordance with Part Three, Title V of that Regulation;






(b) 


for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation;




(c) 


when calculating the values referred to in point (a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;




(e) 


where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;




(f) 


where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;




(h) 


when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following:


where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost;




(i) 


where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall:


(i) 


notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation;




(ii) 


for a period of three months, it may use a value of NGR of 0,3 to perform the calculation of PCEred specified in point (h) of this Article;






(j) 


where, at the end of the period specified in point (ii) of point (i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following:


(i) 


stop calculating KCCP;




(ii) 


notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP;






(k) 

for the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure for options and swaptions in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method specified in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall multiply the notional amount of the contract by the absolute value of the option's delta
as set out in point (a) of Article 280(1) of that Regulation;



(l) 


where a CCP has more than one default fund, it shall carry out the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2) for each default fund separately.


Article 50c

the hypothetical capital (KCCP);




(b) 


the sum of pre-funded contributions (DFCM);




(c) 


the amount of its pre-funded financial resources that it is required to use — by law or due to a contractual agreement with its clearing members — to cover its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members before using the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members (DFCCP);

Article 50d
Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP
For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply:


(a) 


where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM;




(b) 

where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources to cover its losses due to the default of one or more of its clearing members after it has depleted its default fund, but before it calls on the contractually committed contributions of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those additional financial resources 
to the total amount of pre-funded contributions (DF) as follows:
